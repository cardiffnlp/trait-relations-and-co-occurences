# trait-relations-and-co-occurences
Code and full result csv files for experiments in: Assessing the Limits of the Distributional Hypothesis in Semantic Spaces: Trait-based Relational Knowledge and the Impact of Co-occurrences

Code is split into directories:
- classifier-code (for training and evaluating with SVM classifiers)
- datasets-code (code used to develop trait-concept datasets)
- embbeding-code (code used for traing w2v models)
- removal-code (code used for extracting and replacing co-occurrence instances)
- wiki-code (code use to pre-process Wikipedia data)

Results directory includes:
- results.csv (results from main experiment with multilabel SVM classifiers)
- results-binary.csv (results from binary SVM classifiers)
